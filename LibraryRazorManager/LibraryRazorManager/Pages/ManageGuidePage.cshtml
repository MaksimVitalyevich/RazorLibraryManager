		<h2 class="manage-title">Let's get started!</h2>
		<p>
			In order to manage your own library how you want, you have to choose book type.
			There are 3 variants: <i>Historical</i>, <i>Guide</i> & <i>Modern</i>.<br /> Simply pick one (book-like) button
			and you'll be sent to book filling form. Example: 
			<span class="inline-preview my-4">
				<button class="shelfbutton-modern-sm">
					<span class="book-spine-sm">
						<span class="book-title-sm">Modern Literature</span>
						<span class="open-text-sm">Create new book...</span>
					</span>
				</button>
			</span>
		</p>
	</section>
	<hr />
	<section class="manage-secondstep">
		<h2 class="manage-title">Book data form:</h2>
		<p>
			Once on the form, you need to fill all 5 main fields: <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Title</strong>,
			<strong>Author</strong>, <strong>Publication Year</strong>, <strong>Serial Number</strong>.<br />
			Field example: 
			<span class="inline-preview my-4">
				<label class="bookform-label-sm">Title:</label>
				<input type="text" readonly value="IT native problems" class="inline-input"/>
			</span>
			Also, there is a specific <i>last field</i> (depends on book type & requirement level). If <i>Modern</i> type is chosen,
			you can select: 
			<span class="inline-preview my-4">
				<label class="bookform-specific-sm">IsDigital?</label>
				<input type="checkbox" readonly value="true" class="inline-input"/>
			</span> 
			- that indicates the digital copy of book. <br />
			<small><i>Note:</i> This field is optional for Modern books.</small><br />
			Once you're done, hit the
			<span class="inline-preview mx-1">
				<button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
			</span> 
			button. And that's how you add/edit books!
